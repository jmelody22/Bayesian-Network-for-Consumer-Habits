This is a project i completed for my university class on Bayesian networks. 
The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle and consists of real consumer buying habits on Amazon. 
Various Bayesian techniques were employed to analyze and understand these buying habits. 
The project was completed in a Jupyter env using python :)
